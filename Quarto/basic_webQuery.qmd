This minimal example demonstrates how to use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [ObservableJS](https://observablehq.com/) to query a Google Cloud Platform Cloud Function, configured as a python flask API, and produce a simple chart.  

The larger projects this supports are: [GitHub: Kester Weather Station](https://github.com/nkester/Kester-Weather-Station) and [GitHub: Kester Weather Visualization Site](https://github.com/nkester/Kester-Weather-Visualization-Site).  



```{ojs}

d3 = require('d3')

```


```{ojs}

measures = await d3.json("https://us-east1-weather-station-ef6ca.cloudfunctions.net/flask_function")

Inputs.table(measures)

```
