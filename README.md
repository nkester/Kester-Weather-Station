# 2_configuring

This project uses the references and plan put forward in the `1_initialplan` project and documents our implementation.  

## The Equipment  

This is the final list of equipment:  

  * Raspberry Pi 3, purchased in 2017  
    * Loaded with Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS: We went with this so we had the full power and options of Ubuntu (as compared to Raspberry OS) while minimizing the overhead that comes with loading Ubuntu Desktop.  
    * 10 GB micro SD memory card
  * The Seeed Studio equipment **To be added**  

## Setting up the Raspberry Pi  

The Raspberry Pi we used was originally purchased through Woot.com in 2017. I intended to use it to create an arcade game console with the kids but we weren't ready for that yet. The build comes from https://www.canakit.com/. The kit came with an SD card pre-loaded with the 2017 version of NOOBs. This did not have the option to install Ubuntu so I used the Raspberry Pi Installer, avalaible here at the [Raspberry Pi Website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and flashed the SD card with Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS. Using this approach was helpful because it pre-loaded the login information for my WiFi network and performed some other configurations that made it easy to get started once in the Raspberry Pi.

Through the Raspberry Pi Installer we set our WiFi connection information, out hostname (`kesterweather`), our username (`kesterweather`), and our password.

Once we put the Raspberry Pi 3 kit together and started it up, we ran a standard `update` and `upgrade` before moving forward with the following code:  

```{bash}
sudo apt update

sudo apt upgrade -y
```  

At this point we were ready to start installing the required components for Chirpstack.
